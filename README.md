This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from *statistikbanken** on house and appartment prices asswel as the changes in the interest rate.
3. Model project. We model a Bertrand and a Courtot model.

1. Inagural 

In this project, we are solving a simple economic model involving a household with both a male and a female member. The objective is to maximize their utility by optimizing their time allocation between different activities. We will focus on the decision-making process regarding the allocation of time between wage work and household work. By analyzing the changes in wage rates and hours worked at home, we aim to illustrate how the household's utility can be maximized. We will use this analysis to gain insights into the optimal time allocation strategy for the household.

2. Data project

In this project, we analyze the development of house and apartment prices in Denmark over the past 25 years. We compare the prices across different counties in Denmark to gain insights into regional variations. Additionally, we examine the growth rates of these prices to assess the market volatility between Copenhagen and Northern Jutland. By conducting this analysis, we aim to understand the trends and patterns in the Danish housing market and identify potential differences in price dynamics between regions.


3. Model project

In this project, our aim is to optimize the behavior of two firms in both a Bertrand and Cournot competition setting. We utilize both numerical and analytical solutions to determine the price outcomes over time in the Bertrand model. For the Cournot model, we introduce repetition and consider limited rationality to determine the quantities produced by the firms over time. By conducting this analysis, we seek to understand how different competitive strategies impact price dynamics in the market and examine the effects of repeated interactions and limited rationality on firms' quantity decisions.

Exam project

In the exam project, we begin by solving a maximization problem concerning optimal taxation and government consumption. We determine the optimal labor supply choice and explore how it varies with different parameters.
In the second problem, our goal is to maximize profits for a hair salon by considering various policies.
In the third problem, we apply a Griewank function to implement a global optimizer using a multistart approach for faster convergence."
